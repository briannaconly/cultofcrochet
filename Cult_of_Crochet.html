              This has been a long dream of mine to create a site where like-minded people could gather and share and create crafts together, in time I hope to grow this site and expand it to do just that. For now, I will just share things I have learned in my 15+ years of crocheting.
            It started when I was 12, I’ve always been a very crafty and artsy individual, and love working with my hands and creating just about anything. I even still have my very first project! A simple beanie that I am still very proud of and like to look back at and see how far I’ve progressed as a hooker (in the craft we lovingly refer to ourselves as Happy Hookers). On this site you find tips and tricks that I’ve learned and use over the years. Some of my favorite projects that I have done and links to the patterns. Lastly, I have the bragging section, pictures of my completed projects (that I remembered to take pictures of). Hopefully this site will encourage you to pick up that long-forgotten crochet hook or inspire you to try it for yourself. Happy hooking everyone!
